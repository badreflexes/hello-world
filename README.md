# hello-world
Just another repository.
I'm brand new to coding and I hope to get better for school.
I'll be starting school for computer science in August of this year. 
I'm hoping to be more prepared for school and the real world to hopefully get a nice career.
Becoming a software engineer is my longterm goal.
